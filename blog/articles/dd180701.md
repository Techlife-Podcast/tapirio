I made a handwritten typeface ***Slimamif***, it's free for both personal and commercial use. It has over 1000 different characters and supports lots of languages in Latin, Cyrillic, Georgian and Greek with lots of various diacritic marks and special glyphs. Stylistically it's thin and something between handwritten and Art Nouveau.
